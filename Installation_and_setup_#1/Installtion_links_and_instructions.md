# Setting Up Your C Programming Environment

Welcome to the C Programming Tutorial playlist! Before you dive into coding, it's essential to set up your programming environment. This guide will walk you through installing and configuring GCC and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to get you ready for coding.

## Installing GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

1. **Windows**:
   - Download the MinGW zip file from this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J10JDUijGxiJ25wiSlyEG0QiLmiE2Xsr/view?usp=drive_link).
   - Unzip the file.
   - Move the unzipped folder to the `C:\` drive (resulting in a path like `C:\mingw`).
   - Navigate to the `bin` folder inside the MinGW folder.
   - Copy the path to this `bin` folder.

2. **Add MinGW to System Path**:
   - Type "Edit environment variables for your account" in the Windows search bar and select it.
   - Click on "Environment Variables..."
   - Under "User variables", find the "Path" variable and click "Edit".
   - Add a new entry with the copied path to the MinGW `bin` folder.
   - Click "OK" to close the dialogs.

## Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

1. **Download VS Code**: 
   - You can download Visual Studio Code from the official website: [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

2. **Install VS Code**:
